Basic Computer Vision Questions?
	1) What the object is in the Image?
	2) Where the object is located in the Image?
	3) How to use the info?

Challenges:
	1) Noise in the Image
	2) Lighting/Scale/Orientation
	3) Lack if Data

GrayScale Image --> Matrix of Digit with range 0-255

Coloured Image --> Three Planes each made of RED GREEN BLUE colors with matrix of digit of range 0-255 
	
Origin will always start from TOP LEFT CORNER

Stages of Computer Vision:
	1) Capture
	2) Pre-processing -- filtering
	3) Feature Extraction -- Countour, Edge
	4) Build ML Model --Supervised, Unsupervised
	5) Real World manipulation -- Tracking, Path planning

Whereas Image Processing consists of:
	1) Capture
	2) Pre-processing -- filtering
	3) Feature Extraction -- Countour, Edge
